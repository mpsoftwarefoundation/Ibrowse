## Overview
Ibrowse is the browser for those who love:

- **Minimalism 🎛️**

Ibrowse has a very lightweight UI and doesn't bombard you with actions and widgets.

Ibrowse is incredibly secure, as everything from bookmarks to passwords are stored entirely on your local machine.

- **Ease Of Use 🍰**

Ibrowse doesn't require special knowledge to use it, you can cut to the chase and start browsing!

## Free And Open-Source
Ibrowse is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get
the latest and greatest, all licensed under the GPL. Ibrowse currently has prebuilt binaries for Windows,
but can be run on macOS and Linux by cloning this repository.
